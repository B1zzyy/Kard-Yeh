I can see the issue - it's a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error when trying to upload to Firebase Storage. This happens because you're running the app locally on `http://localhost:8000` but Firebase Storage doesn't allow requests from localhost by default. Let me check the current script to see how the upload is handled and fix it.

I can see the issue. The CORS error is happening because Firebase Storage requires proper CORS configuration for localhost development. Let me fix this by implementing a better fallback system and also check if we need to configure Firebase Storage rules.

---

Read file: script.js

---

I can see the issue clearly now. The CORS error is preventing Firebase Storage uploads from localhost. Let me modify the code to handle this gracefully by immediately falling back to base64 encoding when running locally, and add better error handling.

Read file: script.js

Perfect! The fix has been applied. Now when you're running the app on localhost, it will automatically skip Firebase Storage (which causes CORS issues) and use base64 encoding instead. This should resolve the buffering issue you were experiencing.

The key changes made:

1. **Localhost detection**: The code now checks if you're running on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
2. **Immediate fallback**: Instead of trying Firebase Storage first and then falling back, it goes straight to base64 encoding when on localhost
3. **Better logging**: More descriptive console messages to show what's happening

When you deploy this to a production domain later, it will automatically use Firebase Storage since it won't be running on localhost anymore.

Try uploading a profile picture now - it should work smoothly without the buffering/CORS errors! [[memory:3826466]]

_**Assistant**_

The issue now is that Firestore has a limit of ~1MB per document field, and your base64-encoded image (2.6MB original file) is exceeding that limit. Let me fix this by adding image compression before storing it.

---

Read file: script.js

---



---

Perfect! I've added image compression to the `fileToBase64` function. Now when you upload a profile picture on localhost, it will:

1. **Resize the image** to a maximum of 400x400 pixels while maintaining aspect ratio
2. **Compress it to JPEG** with 70% quality to reduce file size
3. **Stay well under Firestore's 1MB limit** for document fields

The compression should reduce your 2.6MB image to something much smaller (likely under 100KB) while still maintaining good visual quality for a profile picture.

Try uploading your profile picture again - it should work smoothly now without the Firestore size limit error! [[memory:3826466]]

---

_**User**_

NICE IT WORKS! Thank you. what is the maximum number of mb we support now?

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! I'm glad it's working now! 

Based on the compression settings I implemented, here's what we support:

**Input file size:** Up to **5MB** (this is the validation limit I kept in the original code)

**After compression:** The image gets compressed to well under **1MB** (Firestore's limit), typically around **50-150KB** depending on the image content.

The compression works by:
- Resizing to max 400x400 pixels
- Converting to JPEG with 70% quality
- This usually results in 95%+ size reduction

So you can upload images up to 5MB, but they'll be automatically compressed to a much smaller, web-friendly size that works perfectly for profile pictures while staying within Firestore's limits. The 5MB input limit prevents users from uploading extremely large files that would take too long to process.

this is great, can we now change the colour of the number of coins to white please? I want the svg of the coins to remain that colour but i want the amount to be in white

---

_**Assistant**_

Read file: styles.css

---



---

Perfect! I've changed the color of the coin count number to white while keeping the coin icon (SVG) in its original golden color (#f59e0b). Now the coin amount will display in white text while the coin icon maintains its distinctive golden appearance. [[memory:3826466]]

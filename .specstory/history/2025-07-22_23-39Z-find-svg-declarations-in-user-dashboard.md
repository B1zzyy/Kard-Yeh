I'll help you find where the SVGs are declared in the ranked game selection/button within the user dashboard. Let me search through the codebase to locate this.

Based on the search results, I can see where the SVGs are declared for the ranked game selection button in the user dashboard. Let me examine the specific code more closely.

---

Read file: styles.css

---

Perfect! I found where the SVGs are declared for the ranked game selection button in the user dashboard. Here's the location:

**File:** `styles.css`  
**Lines:** 2390-2450

The SVG for the **Ranked Mode** button (the second mode card) is declared in the CSS using a `::before` pseudo-element:

```css
.mode-card:nth-child(2)::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    width: 180px;
    height: 180px;
    background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg fill='%23ffffff' viewBox='0 0 60 60' id='Capa_1' version='1.1' xml:space='preserve' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink' stroke='%23ffffff'%3E...");
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    opacity: 0.15;
    z-index: 0;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

This CSS rule:
1. Targets the **second mode card** (`:nth-child(2)`) which is the "Ranked Mode" button
2. Uses a `::before` pseudo-element to add the SVG as a background image
3. The SVG is encoded as a data URL with a **money/coins** icon (appropriate for the ranked mode that costs coins)
4. Sets the opacity to 0.15 to make it a subtle background element
5. Positions it behind the text content (z-index: 0)

For comparison, there's also a similar declaration for the **Practice Mode** button (first mode card) around lines 2350-2390 that uses a target/bullseye SVG icon.

_**Assistant**_

I'll add the same styling principle to the tournament section/button using the SVG you provided. Let me add the CSS rule for the third mode card (tournament).

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully added the tournament SVG background to the third mode card (Tournament button) using the same styling principle as the other mode cards. Here's what was added:

## Added CSS Rules:

1. **Container styling** for the tournament mode card:
   ```css
   .mode-card:nth-child(3) {
       position: relative;
       overflow: hidden;
   }
   ```

2. **SVG background** using the `::before` pseudo-element:
   ```css
   .mode-card:nth-child(3)::before {
       content: '';
       position: absolute;
       top: 50%;
       left: 50%;
       transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
       width: 180px;
       height: 180px;
       background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
       background-size: contain;
       background-repeat: no-repeat;
       background-position: center;
       opacity: 0.15;
       z-index: 0;
       pointer-events: none;
   }
   ```

3. **Content layering** to ensure text appears above the SVG:
   ```css
   .mode-card:nth-child(3) h4,
   .mode-card:nth-child(3) p,
   .mode-card:nth-child(3) .mode-reward {
       position: relative;
       z-index: 1;
   }
   ```

## Result:

Now all three mode cards have their respective background SVGs:
- **Practice Mode**: Target/bullseye icon
- **Ranked Mode**: Money/coins icon  
- **Tournament Mode**: Trophy icon (the one you provided)

The tournament button will now display the trophy SVG as a subtle background element (15% opacity) behind the "Tournament" text, maintaining the same visual consistency as the other mode cards.

how do i push the changes to the github now? dont run the commands just tell me what they are

---

_**Assistant**_

To push your changes to GitHub, you'll need to run these commands in sequence:

1. **Add the changes to staging:**
   ```
   git add .
   ```
   (This adds all modified files, or you can be specific with `git add styles.css`)

2. **Commit the changes:**
   ```
   git commit -m "Add trophy SVG background to tournament mode card"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```
   (Assuming your main branch is called "main" - it could also be "master" depending on your repository setup)

**Alternative single command approach:**
You could also use:
```
git commit -am "Add trophy SVG background to tournament mode card"
```
This combines adding and committing in one step (the `-a` flag automatically stages modified files, and `-m` adds the commit message).

**Note:** Make sure you're in the correct directory (your project root) when running these commands, and that you have the proper Git remote configured for your GitHub repository.

I can see the issue! Looking at the code, I found that the dashboard stats panel has styling defined, but it's missing mobile-specific responsive styles. The desktop version looks good, but on mobile it needs adjustments for proper sizing, positioning, and touch interaction.

Let me add the missing mobile responsive styles for the dashboard stats panel:

---



---

Let me first read the current styles.css file to see the exact content and find where to add the mobile responsive styles for the dashboard stats panel.

---

Read file: styles.css

---

Now I can see the structure. I need to add mobile responsive styles for the dashboard stats panel. Let me add the mobile styles right after the existing dashboard stats styles:

---



---

Perfect! I've added comprehensive mobile responsive styles for the dashboard stats panel. Here's what was added to fix the mobile styling issues:

## Added Styles:

### **Base Component Styles:**
- **Header elements**: Proper styling for username, title, and avatar
- **Stats content**: Flexbox layout for wins/losses display
- **Ratio visualization**: Win/loss ratio bar with proper colors and animations

### **Mobile Responsive Styles (768px and below):**
- **Panel sizing**: Responsive width/height with proper margins
- **Avatar**: Smaller size (100px) with reduced shadow
- **Typography**: Scaled down font sizes for mobile readability
- **Spacing**: Reduced margins and padding for mobile screens

### **Extra Small Mobile (480px and below):**
- **Further size reductions**: Even smaller avatar (80px) and text
- **Tighter spacing**: Optimized for very small screens
- **Touch-friendly**: Appropriate sizing for finger interaction

# Adjust game table layout and card size (2025-07-21 19:46Z)

right can we now re-arrange the game table a tiny bit? I want my hand and the persons hand to appear close to the bottom of the screen where 1/4 of the card is going off the screen. I also want all of the cards in the handss to be bigger than what they are now.

I'll modify the CSS to make the cards larger and position the hands at the bottom of the screen with 1/4 of the cards extending off-screen.

[[memory:3826466]] [[memory:3826318]] I've updated the game table layout to position both player hands at the bottom of the screen with larger cards. Here are the changes made:

**Card Size & Layout Changes:**
- Increased card dimensions from 140×196px to 180×252px (about 30% larger)
- Enhanced card shadows and border radius for better visual appeal
- Scaled up font sizes for card suits (2rem → 2.5rem) and values (1.4rem → 1.8rem)
- Increased center card symbols from 3rem to 4rem

**Positioning Changes:**
- Player area now positioned absolutely at `bottom: -50px` so 1/4 of the cards extend off-screen
- Opponent cards positioned at `top: -50px` for similar off-screen effect at the top
- Increased card container heights from 180px to 280px to accommodate larger cards
- Added `overflow: hidden` to game area to cleanly clip the off-screen portions

**Visual Improvements:**
- Enhanced card shadows for better depth perception with larger cards
- Adjusted deck size proportionally (80×112px → 100×140px)
- Updated custom card image padding and border radius to match new card size

The cards now appear much larger and both the player's hand and opponent's hand extend partially off their respective screen edges, creating the effect you requested.

it didnt work, the placements are all over the place! please ensure that the table cards (the cards placed on the table) remain in the middle of the screen, and the cards in the hands of the players are simply enlarged and placed at the bottom and top most parts of the screen, where a 1/4 of the height of the cards are going off the screen

[[memory:3826466]] [[memory:3826318]] I've fixed the layout to properly separate the player hands from the center area. Here are the corrected changes:

**Fixed Layout Structure:**
- **Opponent area**: Positioned absolutely at `top: -63px` with height `189px` (exactly 1/4 of card height off-screen)
- **Player area**: Positioned absolutely at `bottom: -63px` with height `189px` (exactly 1/4 of card height off-screen)  
- **Center area**: Remains as `flex: 1` to occupy the middle space for table cards

**Proper Card Positioning:**
- Card height is 252px, so -63px positioning shows exactly 189px (3/4 of the card)
- Opponent cards use `flex-direction: column-reverse` to align properly from the top
- Player cards use normal `flex-direction: column` to align from the bottom
- Both hand areas have small margins (10px) to separate from their card containers

**Center Area Preserved:**
- The center area maintains its original flex layout to keep table cards in the middle
- Deck and any played cards will remain centered on screen
- Hand positioning is now completely independent of the center game area

The cards are now larger (180×252px) and positioned so exactly 1/4 extends off-screen at top and bottom, while the center table area remains untouched for gameplay elements.

# Improve card animations for smoother gameplay (2025-07-23 01:42Z)

_**User**_

Right today, a bit stepping stone awaits for us. We will be adding multiplayer functionality to our game, where players would be able to play against each other online not against the bot. Could we please start implementing this? THERE ARE NO ISSUES IN THE CODE AND THE LOGIC, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT AND WORKS AS IT SHOULD BE FOR SINGLE PLAYER AGAINS THE BOT, WE SIMPLY NOW WANT TO ADD MULTIPLAYER FUNCTIONALITY.

FIRST START BY CHANGING THE TEXT OF THE "Touranement Mode" to "Play Online"

I'll help you add multiplayer functionality to your card game! Let me start by understanding the current codebase and then make the first change you requested.

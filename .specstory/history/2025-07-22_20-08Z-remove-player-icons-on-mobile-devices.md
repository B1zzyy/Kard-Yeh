# Remove player icons on mobile devices (2025-07-22 20:08Z)

_**User**_

currently we are displaying the players pfp and opponent icon next to the hands, please get rid of that and the player stats that pop up should now be implemented into the pfp that appears on the current score window

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you move the player stats from the popup to the profile pictures in the score window and remove the pfp/opponent icons next to the hands. Let me first examine the current implementation to understand the structure.

Looking at the code, I can see that there are currently player and opponent avatars/icons displayed next to the hands, and there's a separate popup stats panel. I need to:

1. Remove the player and opponent info (avatars/names) that appear next to the hands
2. Make the player stats clickable through the profile picture in the score window (game UI)
3. Ensure the stats show when clicking on the score window avatar

Let me make these changes:

Perfect! The HTML changes have been applied. Now I need to update the JavaScript to make the profile picture in the score window clickable for showing stats, and also create a new stats panel that appears when clicking on the score window avatar.

---

```diff
      }
      
-     // Player avatar click in game area
-     if (event.target.id === 'player-avatar' || event.target.closest('#player-avatar')) {
+     // Game score window player avatar click
+     if (event.target.id === 'game-player-avatar' || event.target.closest('#game-player-avatar')) {
          event.preventDefault();
          event.stopPropagation();
-         togglePlayerStatsPanel();
+         toggleGameStatsPanel();
      }
      
```

```diff
      }
      
-     // Close stats panel when clicking elsewhere
-     const statsPanel = document.getElementById('player-stats-panel');
-     if (statsPanel && statsPanel.classList.contains('expanded')) {
-         if (!event.target.closest('.player-stats-panel') && !event.target.closest('#player-avatar')) {
-             closePlayerStatsPanel();
+     // Close game stats panel when clicking elsewhere
+     const gameStatsPanel = document.getElementById('game-stats-panel');
+     if (gameStatsPanel && gameStatsPanel.style.display === 'block') {
+         if (!event.target.closest('.game-stats-panel') && !event.target.closest('#game-player-avatar')) {
+             closeGameStatsPanel();
          }
      }
```

Now I need to add the new functions for handling the game stats panel and create the HTML structure for it. Let me add these functions:

---



---

Now I need to remove the CSS styles that are no longer needed for the player/opponent info sections, and also clean up any references to the old elements in the JavaScript. Let me update the CSS:

---

Now let me remove the old player avatar and stats panel CSS that's no longer needed:

---



---



---



---



---



---



---



---



---



---



---

Now I need to make the score avatars clickable by adding the cursor pointer style. Let me also update the JavaScript to ensure the game UI updates the avatar properly:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the requested changes:

## Summary of Changes Made:

### 1. **Removed Player/Opponent Info from Hands**
- Removed the `.player-info` and `.opponent-info` sections from the HTML that were displayed next to the card hands
- This includes the player avatar, opponent avatar, player name, and opponent name that appeared beside the cards

### 2. **Moved Stats to Score Window Avatar**
- The player stats are now accessible by clicking on the profile picture in the game's score window (the UI panel in the top-left)
- The score window avatar is now clickable (added hover effects and cursor pointer)

### 3. **Updated Stats Panel Implementation**
- Created a new `toggleGameStatsPanel()` function that shows stats when clicking the score window avatar
- The stats panel now appears as a centered overlay (similar to other popups in the game) with the dark blue gradient background [[memory:3998406]]
- Stats panel shows the player's profile picture, name, wins/losses, and win/loss ratio with a visual progress bar

### 4. **Clean Code**
- Removed all CSS styles related to the old player/opponent info sections
- Updated JavaScript event handlers to use the new score window avatar instead of the old player avatar
- Removed unused functions and references to the old stats panel system

### 5. **Maintained Consistency**
- The new stats popup uses the same styling as other confirmation dialogs in the game [[memory:3998541]]
- No emojis are used in the interface, maintaining the clean design preference [[memory:3995989]]

The game now has a cleaner look with the hands area focused purely on the cards, while player statistics are easily accessible through the profile picture in the score window. The implementation maintains all the existing functionality while improving the user interface organization.

perfect can we also now make the throw in and collect animations quicker on both desktop and mobile?

I can see the throw in and collect animations in the code. Let me make them quicker by reducing the duration values in the animation functions. I'll focus on the key animation functions that handle card throwing and collecting.

Now let me update the AI move animation to make it faster:

---

Now let me update the capture animations to be much faster:

- Cards now appear almost twice as fast when dealt

### 2. **AI Move Animations** 
- **Card throw duration**: Reduced from `0.3s` to `0.15s` (50% faster)
- **Capture stagger**: Reduced from `0.05s` to `0.02s` between cards (60% faster)
- **Fade out duration**: Reduced from `0.2s` to `0.1s` (50% faster)
- **Total capture time**: Reduced from `1.0s` to `0.5s` (50% faster)

### 3. **Player Move Animations**
- **Card throw duration**: Reduced from `0.4s` to `0.2s` (50% faster)

okay i need you to do something else now, the end of round pop up which displays when the end of the round happens, i believe stays for about 7-10 seconds i cannot remember, please change it to 5 and make sure the text thats says the next round start in is updated dynamically with a countdown

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the end of round popup to show for only 5 seconds and add a dynamic countdown. Let me first find the round score popup function to see how it's currently implemented.

I found the round score popup function! I can see it currently has a 10-second auto-close timer and shows static text. Let me modify it to show for 5 seconds with a dynamic countdown.

Now let me update the auto-close timer from 10 seconds to 5 seconds and add the dynamic countdown functionality:

thank you

I need to fix the linter error by renaming the variable since `isGameOver` is already declared earlier in the function. Let me fix this:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the end of round popup with the requested changes:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Reduced Display Time**
- Changed from **10 seconds** to **5 seconds** total display time

### 2. **Added Dynamic Countdown**
- The text now shows "Starting Round X in 5..." initially
- Updates every second: "Starting Round X in 4...", "Starting Round X in 3...", etc.
- Countdown only appears for non-game-over rounds (when there's actually a next round)

### 3. **Fixed Linter Error**
- Removed the duplicate `isGameOver` variable declaration that was causing the error
- Used the existing `isGameOver` variable that was already calculated earlier in the function

## How It Works:
1. **Initial Display**: Shows "Starting Round X in 5..." 
2. **Every Second**: Decrements the countdown and updates the text
3. **Auto-Close**: After 5 seconds, the popup automatically fades out
4. **Manual Close**: Users can still click the overlay to close it immediately
5. **Game Over**: When the game is over, it shows "Game Over!" without countdown

The popup now provides better feedback to players about when the next round will start, making the game flow feel more responsive and informative!

can you change the text to simply say "Starting next round in...."

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Now let me update the countdown text in the interval as well:

---



---

Perfect! I've updated the text to be simpler and more concise. Now the end of round popup will show:

- **Initial text**: "Starting next round in 5..."
- **Countdown updates**: "Starting next round in 4...", "Starting next round in 3...", etc.
- **Game over text**: "Game Over!" (unchanged)

This makes the message cleaner and easier to read, while still providing the dynamic countdown functionality you requested. The text is now more straightforward and doesn't include the specific round number, making it feel less cluttered.

# Fix card positioning and hover effects (2025-07-21 03:03Z)

_**User**_

can we decrease the spread of the cards when hovred over? at the moment the cards move quiter a lot and dont go back to their original position when hovered over. Can we please fix this?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll fix the hover effects for the cards to reduce the spread and ensure they return to their original positions properly.

I need to look at the actual project files in your workspace to fix the card hover effects. Let me first check what files are available.

I can see the project structure now. Let me examine the script.js file to find and fix the hover effects for the cards.

Read file: script.js

I need to see more of the script.js file, particularly the `positionCardsInHand` function where the player card hover effects are defined. Let me look at that section.

---

Read file: script.js

---

Now I can see the hover effects in both the `positionCardsInHand` and `positionTableCards` functions. I'll fix the hover effects to reduce the movement and ensure proper position restoration. Let me update the script.js file:

Perfect! I've successfully reduced the hover effects for the player cards. Now let me also fix the table card hover effects to make them more subtle and consistent:

---



---

Great! I've successfully reduced the hover effects for both player cards and table cards. Here's a summary of the changes I made:

**Player Cards:**
- Reduced hover lift from 20px to 10px
- Less rotation straightening (0.8 instead of 0.5 multiplier)
- Smaller scale increase (1.03 instead of 1.05)
- Subtler glow effect
- Slightly longer return animation (0.4s instead of 0.3s) for smoother feel

**Table Cards:**
- Reduced hover lift from 8px to 5px
- Less rotation straightening (0.8 instead of 0.5 multiplier)
- Smaller scale increase (1.02 instead of 1.03)
- More subtle glow effect

These changes will make the card hover effects much more subtle while still providing visual feedback. The cards will now move less dramatically when hovered over and should return more smoothly to their original positions when the mouse leaves.

no the cards are still spreading out quite a lot, i dont need them to move sidewats (xaxis) when hovered over, i just need them to move up slightly when hovered and when i move the mouse away from the card i want it to go back to its original position

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand! You want the cards to only move up (Y-axis) when hovered, not sideways, and return to their exact original position. Let me fix that by removing the X-axis movement and rotation changes from the hover effects.

Perfect! I've fixed the hover effects so that cards now:

**Player Cards:**
- Only move up 15px when hovered (no sideways movement or rotation changes)
- Scale up slightly to 1.05 for emphasis
- Return to their exact original position when mouse leaves

**Table Cards:**
- Only move up 10px when hovered (no sideways movement or rotation changes)
- Scale up slightly to 1.03 for emphasis
- Return to their exact original position when mouse leaves

Now the cards will stay in their original horizontal positions and rotations, only lifting up slightly when you hover over them, and smoothly returning to their exact original positions when you move the mouse away. This should give you the clean, predictable hover behavior you wanted!

okay, we are nearly there, the cards do indeed move very slighly up when hovered which i like, but please look for a function or something that is responsible for the card movement when UN-hovered, because after unhovering the cards tend to move sideways and rotate instead of going back to their original position

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue! In the `mouseleave` event handlers, the cards are being animated back to their `originalTransform` values, which includes the X position and rotation. But since we removed those from the `mouseenter` animation, we need to make sure the `mouseleave` only animates back the properties we actually changed (Y position and scale).

Let me fix the mouseleave handlers:

---



---

Now let me fix the table cards mouseleave handler as well:

---



---

Perfect! Now I've fixed both the player cards and table cards mouseleave handlers. The changes ensure that:

**On Hover:**
- Cards only move up (Y-axis) and scale slightly
- No X-axis movement or rotation changes

**On Unhover:**
- Cards only animate the Y position and scale back to their original values
- X position and rotation remain completely untouched, so no sideways movement or unwanted rotation

This should give you the clean hover behavior you wanted - cards lift up slightly when hovered and smoothly return to their exact original position when you move the mouse away, with no sideways drift or rotation changes.

_**User**_

can you tell me which functions are responsible for the hover and unhover effects?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the code I just modified, the hover and unhover effects are handled within these two functions:

## 1. `positionCardsInHand(cards, isPlayer)` 
**Location:** Around lines 540-600 in script.js

This function handles the **player hand cards** hover effects. Within this function, there are event listeners added to each card:

```javascript
card.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
    // Hover effect - moves card up and scales it
    gsap.to(card, {
        duration: 0.3,
        y: originalTransform.y - 15, // Only move up
        scale: 1.05, // Slight scale increase
        zIndex: 100,
        ease: "power2.out"
    });
    // Add glow effect
    card.style.boxShadow = '...';
});

card.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
    // Unhover effect - returns card to original position
    gsap.to(card, {
        duration: 0.4,
        y: originalTransform.y, // Only animate Y back
        scale: originalTransform.scale, // Only animate scale back
        zIndex: originalTransform.zIndex,
        ease: "power2.out"
    });
    // Remove glow effect
    card.style.boxShadow = '';
});
```

## 2. `positionTableCards(cards)`
**Location:** Around lines 610-680 in script.js

This function handles the **table cards** hover effects with similar event listeners:

```javascript
card.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
    // Hover effect for table cards
    gsap.to(card, {
        duration: 0.3,
        y: originalTransform.y - 10, // Only move up
        scale: 1.03, // Slight scale increase
        zIndex: 100,
        ease: "power2.out"
    });
    // Add glow effect
    card.style.boxShadow = '...';
});

card.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
    // Unhover effect for table cards
    gsap.to(card, {
        duration: 0.3,
        y: originalTransform.y, // Only animate Y back
        scale: originalTransform.scale, // Only animate scale back
        zIndex: originalTransform.zIndex,
        ease: "power2.out"
    });
    // Remove glow effect
    card.style.boxShadow = '';
});
```

These are the only two functions responsible for the card hover/unhover animations in your game.

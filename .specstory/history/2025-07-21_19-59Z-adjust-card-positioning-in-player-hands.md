[[memory:3826466]][[memory:3814863]]I've updated the CSS to make the cards in players' hands closer together with overlapping edges. The changes include:

1. **Changed display to flex**: Both `.opponent-cards` and `.player-cards` now use flexbox for better card positioning
2. **Added negative margins**: Cards now have `-100px` left margin to create significant overlap
3. **First card exception**: The first card in each hand doesn't get the negative margin to prevent it from going off-screen

The cards will now overlap substantially at their edges, creating the closer, more compact hand appearance you requested. The overlap is quite pronounced (-100px) so the cards will be much closer together than before.

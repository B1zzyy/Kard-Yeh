I need to examine the current state of the code to understand why the authentication flow isn't working properly. Let me check the JavaScript file to see what's happening.

Read file: script.js

I can see the issue. The authentication flow is working, but there's a problem with the screen transitions. The game is getting stuck on the animated background screen instead of progressing to the actual game. Let me examine the authentication and game flow logic more carefully.

[[memory:3826466]] I can see the issue now. Looking at the code, the authentication flow is working, but there's a problem with the screen transitions. The game is getting stuck showing the animated background (which is part of the auth screen) instead of progressing to the actual game.

The issue is in the `selectGameMode` function around line 367. When a user selects "Practice Mode", it calls `startGameFlow()` which should show the main menu, but there's a disconnect in the screen management.

Let me fix the screen transition logic:

I see the fix was applied, but there's still an issue. The problem is that when users select "Practice Mode", it calls `startGameFlow()` which should show the main menu for opponent selection, but the flow isn't working correctly. Let me fix the `startGameFlow` function to properly handle practice mode:

Perfect! The fixes look good. Now the game should properly transition from the dashboard to the appropriate screens. When users select:

1. **Practice Mode**: They'll go to the main menu to select number of opponents and then difficulty
2. **Ranked Mode**: They'll skip the menus and go directly to a 1v1 game with medium difficulty

The key fixes were:
- Ensuring all screens are properly hidden when transitioning
- Making sure the auth screen background doesn't stay visible
- Properly showing the main menu for practice mode instead of calling the problematic `showMainMenuFromDashboard()` function

The game should now work correctly - users can authenticate, select their game mode, and proceed through the proper game flow without getting stuck on the animated background screen.

# Move cards off the edge of the screen (2025-07-21 22:21Z)

_**User**_

pelase move the cards of me and the opponent to the edge of the screen, i even need them to run off the edge of the screen 25%, so that the bottom 25% of my cards are hidden and the top 25% of their cards is also hidden. does that make sense?

I understand! You want the player cards at the very bottom edge with 25% cut off below the screen, and opponent cards at the very top edge with 25% cut off above the screen. This will create a more immersive table view.

Perfect! I can see the changes have been applied successfully. The opponent cards are now positioned at `top: -80px` (moving them up so 25% is hidden above the screen) and the player cards are at `bottom: -80px` (moving them down so 25% is hidden below the screen).

This creates the immersive effect you wanted where:
- Your cards at the bottom have their bottom 25% cut off by the screen edge
- The opponent's cards at the top have their top 25% cut off by the screen edge

The 80px offset is calculated from the 320px card area height, so exactly 25% (80px) of each card area extends beyond the screen boundaries. This should give you that realistic table view where cards naturally extend beyond your field of vision!

Perfect! I've updated the player statistics popup positioning to display to the right of the player's profile picture instead of above it. Here's what I changed:

**Position Changes:**
- Moved from `top: -120px` to `top: 50%` (centers it vertically with the avatar)
- Changed from `left: 50%` to `left: 80px` (positions it to the right of the 60px avatar with 20px gap)
- Updated transforms from `translateX(-50%)` to `translateY(-50%)` to center it vertically

**Animation Updates:**
- Renamed the animation from `panelSlideUp` to `panelSlideRight`
- Changed the animation to slide in from the left instead of from above
- Updated all transform properties to maintain the new positioning

Now when you hover over your player avatar, the statistics panel will appear smoothly sliding in from the left and position itself to the right of your profile picture, creating a much better user experience that doesn't interfere with your hand of cards!

 right, i see that the player stats pop up is now displaying slightly right of the left of the screen, can you please make sure it appears to the right relative of the pfp circle when clicked

I see the issue! The player stats panel is currently positioned with a fixed `left: 80px` from the screen edge, but it should be positioned relative to the avatar itself. Let me fix this by making the avatar container relative and positioning the panel relative to it.

---

---

Perfect! I've fixed the positioning by:

1. **Making the avatar container relative**: Added `position: relative` to `.player-avatar-container` so the stats panel can be positioned relative to it instead of the screen.

2. **Positioning relative to the avatar**: Changed from `left: 80px` (fixed distance from screen edge) to `left: calc(100% + 15px)` which means:
   - `100%` = the full width of the avatar container (60px)
   - `+ 15px` = adds a 15px gap between the avatar and the stats panel

Now the player stats popup will always appear to the right of the profile picture with a consistent 15px gap, regardless of where the avatar is positioned on screen. This creates a much more intuitive and visually appealing user experience!

perfect can we now move up the pfp circle just a bit up, be careful which valkue you change in the styling, pay close attention, visit the index.html if you need to beforehand to make sure.

Looking at the HTML structure, I can see that the player avatar is inside `.player-info` which has `margin-top: 15px`. To move the profile picture up, I should reduce this margin value.

---



---

Perfect! I reduced the `margin-top` from `15px` to `5px` on the `.player-info` container. This moves the entire player info section (including the profile picture) up by 10px, giving it a better position relative to the player's hand while still maintaining proper spacing from the cards above.

The profile picture should now appear closer to the cards but still maintain a clean, visually appealing layout!

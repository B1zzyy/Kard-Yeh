# Adjust card spacing in player hand (2025-07-21 11:05Z)

_**User**_

okay, see there is still an issue. i want the cards to always stay close together in the players hand throughout the game, at the moment, there seems to be quite a large padding around the cards or something that is making them spread apart. i want them to be close together throughout the whole game, almost touching or overlapping each other

I'll fix the card spacing issue to keep the cards close together throughout the game. The problem is in the `positionCardsInHand` function where the overlap calculation isn't tight enough.

Perfect! I've updated the card spacing to make them much tighter. The key changes:

1. **Replaced overlap-based calculation** with a simple spacing system
2. **Reduced spacing dramatically**: 
   - Small mobile: 20px spacing
   - Mobile: 25px spacing  
   - Desktop: 30px spacing
3. **Eliminated the complex overlap calculation** that was causing the cards to spread apart

Now the cards will stay very close together throughout the entire game, with only 20-30px between each card instead of the previous 110-125px overlap that was actually creating more space. The cards will appear almost touching or slightly overlapping, exactly as you requested.

The spacing will remain consistent whether you have 1 card or 4 cards in your hand, maintaining that tight, compact look throughout the game.

Perfect! I've made the cards even closer together so they're essentially touching each other's edges. The spacing is now:

- **Small mobile**: 5px spacing
- **Mobile**: 8px spacing  
- **Desktop**: 10px spacing

With these minimal gaps (5-10px), the cards will appear to be touching or nearly touching each other's edges throughout the entire game. This creates that tight, compact hand formation you wanted while still maintaining just enough space to see each individual card clearly.

The cards will stay this close together whether you have 1, 2, 3, or 4 cards in your hand, maintaining that professional card game look where the hand appears as one cohesive unit.

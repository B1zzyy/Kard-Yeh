_**User**_

great, can we now improve the improve the look of the top left box that keeps tracks of the hands, the rounds, the number of cards etc. Before we begin, please have a look at the pop up which displays the end of round info

_**Assistant**_

I'll first examine the current popup that displays end of round info to understand the styling, then look at the top left box that tracks hands, rounds, and card count to improve its appearance.

I'll examine the current top left game info box and the end of round popup to understand the styling, then improve the appearance of the game info box to match the popup's design.

---

Read file: script.js

---

Now I can see the current top left game info box and understand the styling of the end of round popup. The popup uses a beautiful dark blue gradient background with proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy. I'll improve the game info box to match this elegant styling while maintaining its functionality.

[[memory:3998406]] The top left game info box has been successfully updated with a beautiful dark blue gradient background that matches the styling of the end of round popup. The improvements include:

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Applied the same dark blue gradient background (`linear-gradient(135deg, #0f172a 0%, #1e293b 50%, #334155 100%)`) as the popup
- Added proper backdrop blur and subtle border styling
- Increased padding and border radius for a more polished look
- Added box shadow with subtle white border outline

**Better Information Hierarchy:**
- **Header section** with round number and deal indicator (1-6)
- **Score section** with clear player vs AI score display in a highlighted container
- **Cards info section** showing hand count, table cards, and remaining deck cards in organized columns

**Typography & Spacing:**
- Consistent color scheme using white for primary text, `#94a3b8` for secondary text, and `#64748b` for labels
- Proper font weights and sizes for visual hierarchy
- Clean sectional divisions with subtle borders
- Responsive design that scales appropriately on mobile devices

The game info box now provides all the essential game state information in an elegant, easy-to-read format that perfectly complements the overall game design aesthetic.

_**User**_

this is great, but it appears that the box is surrounded by another black coloured box, can we please get rid of the black coloured box?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue! There's likely a black container or background element wrapping around the game info box. Let me examine the current styling and remove that extra black box.

I can see the issue! Looking at the CSS, there are conflicting styles for the `.game-ui` element. The problem is that there are two different CSS rules for `.game-ui` - one that creates the black background and another that applies the new gradient styling. Let me fix this by removing the duplicate/conflicting CSS.

---



---

Perfect! I've removed the duplicate `.game-ui` CSS rule that was creating the black background container around the game info box. The black box was caused by this older styling:

```css
background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
border-radius: 12px;
padding: 15px;
```

Now only the enhanced styling remains, which gives the game info box the beautiful dark blue gradient background that matches the popup design, without any extra black container around it. The game info box should now appear clean with just the gradient background and subtle border styling.

---

_**User**_

this is great, can we also ensure to add the player's pfp's

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add the player's profile picture to the game info box to match the styling used in other parts of the game. Let me examine how profile pictures are currently handled and then add them to the game info box.

I can see how profile pictures are handled throughout the game. I'll add player profile pictures to the game info box in the score section, similar to how they're displayed in the round score popup. Let me update the `updateGameUI` function to include the player's profile picture.

---



---

Now I need to add the CSS styling for the new avatar elements in the game info box. Let me add the styles for `.score-avatar`, `.player-avatar-small`, `.opponent-avatar-small`, and `.score-info`.

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully added player profile pictures to the game info box. Here's what was implemented:

**New Features Added:**
- **Player Avatar**: Shows the user's profile picture (if uploaded) or default avatar in the score section
- **AI Opponent Avatar**: Displays a robot icon to represent the AI opponent
- **Player Name**: Shows the actual player's display name instead of just "You"

**Visual Design:**
- **Small circular avatars** (32px) that match the game's design language
- **Color-coded borders**: Green for player, red for AI opponent
- **Proper spacing and alignment** with the score information
- **Responsive layout** that works with the existing score display structure

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses the same profile picture system as other parts of the game
- Automatically updates when the user changes their profile picture
- Falls back to default emoji avatar if no profile picture is set
- Uses the same gradient backgrounds and styling as the larger avatars elsewhere in the game

The game info box now provides a more personalized and visually appealing experience, showing both players' identities alongside the game statistics, making it easier to quickly identify who's winning at a glance!

---

_**User**_

can we get rid of the coloured borders of the pfp's we just added? and also make the pfp's bigger

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll remove the colored borders from the profile pictures and make them bigger in the game info box.

---



---

Perfect! I've updated the profile pictures in the game info box by:

**Changes Made:**
- **Removed colored borders** - No more green/red borders around the avatars for a cleaner look
- **Increased size** from 32px to 40px - Making the profile pictures more prominent and easier to see
- **Increased font size** from 1rem to 1.2rem - Making the default emoji avatars proportionally larger to match the new size

The profile pictures now have a cleaner, more streamlined appearance that focuses on the actual images/avatars without the distracting colored borders, while being large enough to clearly see the user's profile picture or default avatar.

---

_**User**_

it seems like the box is refreshing after every throw in, as in it flashes instead of dynamically changing the values only

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right! The issue is that the `updateGameUI()` function completely rebuilds the entire HTML content of the game info box every time it's called, which causes the flashing effect. I need to modify it to only update the specific values that change instead of recreating the entire structure.

Let me fix this by separating the initial creation from the value updates:

---



---

Perfect! I've fixed the flashing issue by completely restructuring how the game info box updates. Here's what changed:

**Problem Fixed:**
- **No more flashing** - The box no longer recreates its entire HTML structure on every update
- **Smooth value updates** - Only the specific numbers and text that change get updated

**How it works now:**
1. **Initial Creation**: When the game info box is first created, it builds the complete HTML structure with unique IDs for all dynamic elements
2. **Value Updates**: On subsequent calls, it only updates the specific text content of elements that have changed:
   - Round number
   - Deal number  
   - Player score
   - Opponent score
   - Hand count
   - Table count
   - Deck count
   - Player name and avatar

**Technical Improvements:**
- **Targeted DOM updates** using `getElementById()` and `textContent`
- **Conditional avatar updates** that only change styling when the profile picture changes
- **Preserved styling and animations** since the structure remains intact
- **Better performance** since we're not recreating DOM elements constantly

The game info box now provides a smooth, professional experience with values that update seamlessly without any visual disruption!

---

_**User**_

can we now make the box a bit wider? increase the size of the pfp's a bit also

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll make the game info box wider and increase the size of the profile pictures for better visibility.

---



---



---

Perfect! I've made the requested improvements to the game info box:

**Changes Made:**
- **Wider box**: Increased `min-width` from 220px to 280px, giving more breathing room for all the content
- **Larger profile pictures**: Increased avatar size from 40px to 48px, making them more prominent and easier to see
- **Proportional font scaling**: Increased the default emoji font size from 1.2rem to 1.4rem to match the larger avatar size

These changes make the game info box more visually balanced and the profile pictures more prominent, while maintaining the clean design and smooth updates we just implemented. The extra width also provides better spacing for all the game information elements.

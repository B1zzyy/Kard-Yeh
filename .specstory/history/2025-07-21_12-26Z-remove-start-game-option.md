# Remove start game option (2025-07-21 12:26Z)

_**User**_

okay, i want to change some things in the game. right now when a user logs in they can select a "Start Game" option, they can also select a "Practise Game" option, "Ranked Game" (wins money), and a Tournament option (Coming soon). I want to get rid of the "Start Game" option and only have "Practise" "Ranked (wins money)" and "tournament coming soon". 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the user dashboard to remove the "Start Game" button and keep only the three game mode cards. Let me make the necessary changes to the HTML file.

You're absolutely right! The debugging shows the functions are being called and the styles are being set correctly, but the game area still isn't showing. The issue is likely that the CSS is overriding our JavaScript display changes. Let me fix this by checking what's actually happening and making the necessary corrections.

I can see that the "Start Game" button has already been removed from the HTML file. Looking at the current content, I can see that the dashboard only shows the three game mode cards:

1. üéØ Practice Mode
2. üí∞ Ranked Mode  
3. üèÜ Tournament

The "Start Game" button is no longer present in the HTML. Now I need to remove the JavaScript handler for that button since it's no longer needed.

Perfect! I can see that the "Start Game" button has already been removed from the HTML, and the JavaScript handler has also been removed (I can see the comment "// Removed start game button handler" on line 65).

The dashboard now only shows the three game mode options as you wanted:
- üéØ Practice Mode (free play)
- üí∞ Ranked Mode (costs 100 coins, wins 200 coins)  
- üèÜ Tournament (coming soon)

The changes have been completed successfully. Users can now only access these three specific game modes from the dashboard, and the generic "Start Game" button has been removed.

can we make it so that when a player wants to play ranked, they put in 2500 for entry and win 5000 in return.

Perfect! I've updated both the HTML display and the JavaScript logic to reflect the new ranked game pricing:

**HTML Changes:**
- Updated the Ranked Mode card to show "Cost: 2500 coins" and "Win: +5000 coins"

**JavaScript Changes:**
- Updated the `selectGameMode` function to check for 2500 coins instead of 100
- Updated the confirmation dialog to show the new pricing (2500 entry, 5000 reward)
- Updated the `handleGameRewards` function to award 5000 coins for ranked wins instead of 200
- Updated the victory message to show "+5000 coins earned!"

Now when players select Ranked Mode, they'll need to pay 2500 coins to enter, but they'll earn 5000 coins if they win - making it a high-stakes, high-reward game mode! [[memory:3826466]]

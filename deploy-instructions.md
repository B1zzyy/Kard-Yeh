# 🚀 Deploy Your Konchina Game to Firebase Hosting

## Prerequisites
- Your Firebase project is set up
- You have Node.js installed on your computer

## Step 1: Install Firebase CLI

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

**Windows users**: You might need to run this as Administrator
**Mac users**: You might need to use `sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`

## Step 2: Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

This will open your browser - login with the same Google account you used for Firebase.

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase in Your Project

1. **Navigate to your game folder** in terminal:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\Ben\Desktop\Card Yeh"
   ```

2. **Initialize Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

3. **Answer the prompts**:
   - "Which Firebase features do you want to set up?" → **Select "Hosting"** (use spacebar to select, Enter to continue)
   - "Please select an option" → **"Use an existing project"**
   - "Select a default Firebase project" → **Choose your Konchina project**
   - "What do you want to use as your public directory?" → **Type `.` (just a dot)**
   - "Configure as a single-page app?" → **Type `n` (No)**
   - "Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub?" → **Type `n` (No)**
   - If it asks about overwriting index.html → **Type `n` (No)**

## Step 4: Deploy Your Game

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Wait for it to finish. You'll see something like:
```
✔ Deploy complete!

```

**Your game is now live!** 🎉
